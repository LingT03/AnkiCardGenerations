      "choices": [
        "least connections",

    {
      "question": "Which load balancing algorithm distributes tasks based on the number of active connections each resource has?",
      "choices": [
        "least connections",
        "source IP hash",
        "round robin",
        "least response time"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "least connections",
      "explanation": "Least connections sends new requests to the resource currently handling the fewest active connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the ability of a system to change in order to meet application demands called?",
      "choices": [
        "elasticity",
        "scalability",
        "load balancing",
        "availability"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "scalability",
      "explanation": "Scalability is the system's capacity to handle increasing workloads by adding resources, without impact to performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of auto scaling uses machine learning to predict demand?",
      "choices": ["scheduled", "dynamic", "predictive", "manual"],

      "choices": ["scheduled", "dynamic", "predictive", "manual"],
      "correct_answer": "scheduled",
      "explanation": "Scheduled auto scaling uses specific date/time triggers to scale out or in, perfect for known peak/off-peak times."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of auto scaling, what does the parameter scale_in_cooldown set?",
      "choices": [
        "The target metric level",
        "A cooldown period after a scale-in activity",
        "A cooldown period after a scale-out activity",
        "The desired capacity"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A cooldown period after a scale-in activity",
      "explanation": "scale_in_cooldown prevents immediate subsequent scaling actions, giving the system time to stabilize after shrinking capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of load balancer can request new resources when sensing a demand increase?",
      "choices": [
        "Static load balancer",
        "Network load balancer",
        "Elastic load balancer",
        "DNS-based load balancer"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Elastic load balancer",

        "DNS-based load balancer"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "DNS-based load balancer",
      "explanation": "DNS-based load balancers (e.g., AWS Route 53) use DNS responses to send clients to the appropriate server based on criteria like geo-location."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary goal of dynamic load balancers?",
      "choices": [
        "To distribute tasks equally among resources",
